It leverages a structured anxiety attack dataset with attributes like sleep hours, physical activity, caffeine intake, heart rate, and more.

## Key Features
### Data Cleaning & Exploration: 
Handling missing values, checking data distribution, and ensuring consistency.
### Trend Analysis: 
Identifying correlations between stress levels and lifestyle factors.
### Statistical Insights: 
Computing averages, variance, and detecting anomalies in stress levels.
### Optimization Queries: 
Using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights efficiently.

## Technologies Used
SQL Server for data analysis and querying
ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) to structure the database

Dataset source: Kaggle
